We consider a specific form of domain invasion that is an abstraction of pancreatic tissue eliminating precancerous mutant cell through juxtacrine signalling. The model is explored discretely, continuously, stochastically and deterministically, leading to unforeseen nonlinear dependencies on the solution domain's dimension. Specifically, stochastically simulated populations invade with a dimension dependent wave speed that can be over twice as fast as their deterministic analogues. Although the wave speed can be analytically derived in the cases of small domains, the probablistic state space grows exponentially and, thus, we use numeric simulation and curve fitting to predict limiting dynamics.
